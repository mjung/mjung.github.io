<p>As some of you already know, I will be leaving the University in due
course. Leaving this magnificent organisation behind has been a very
difficult decision to make.</p>
<p>I feel it is more appropriate in the middle of a pandemic to skip the
joys of meeting lots of colleagues and friends. I kindly ask you to
donate generously in lieu of leaving drinks for SpecialEffect. I have
been working with this local charity operating since more than six years
and can only recommend them in the highest terms</p>
<p>SpecialEffect operates out of Charlbury since 2007. They specialise in
helping physically disabled people, specifically children, play video
games. SpecialEffect works with developers to create specialised game
control devices as well as making their games more accessible.</p>
<p>The ability to play video games, now seen as an almost universal
pastime, can help improve the mental health of disabled people who
otherwise could not play them.</p>
